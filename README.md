# Gazelle Plugin for Swift and Swift Package Rules for Bazel

[![Build](https://github.com/cgrindel/rules_swift_package_manager/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=schedule)](https://github.com/cgrindel/rules_swift_package_manager/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains a [Gazelle plugin] and Bazel repository rules that can be used to download,
build, and consume Swift packages. The rules in this repository build the external Swift packages
using [rules_swift] and native C/C++ rulesets making the Swift package products and targets
available as Bazel targets.

This repository is designed to fully replace [rules_spm] and provide utilities to ease Swift
development inside a Bazel workspace.

## Prerequisites

### Mac OS

Be sure to install Xcode.

### Linux

You will need to [install Swift](https://swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift). Make sure
that running `swift --version` works properly.

Don't forget that `rules_swift` [expects the use of
`clang`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift#3-additional-configuration-linux-only). Hence,
you will need to specify `CC=clang` before running Bazel.

Finally, help [rules_swift] and [rules_swift_package_manager] find the Swift toolchain by ensuring that a `PATH`
that includes the Swift binary is available in the Bazel actions.

```sh
cat >>local.bazelrc <<EOF
build --action_env=PATH
EOF
```

This approach is necessary to successfully execute the examples on an Ubuntu runner using Github
actions. See the [CI GitHub workflow] for more details.


## Quickstart

The following provides a quick introduction on how to set up and use the features in this
repository. Also, check out the [examples] for more information.

### 1. Enable bzlmod

This repository supports [bzlmod] as well as [legacy `WORKSPACE` dependencies]. If you
are starting a new project, it is highly recommended to use [bzlmod]. To enable bzlmod, add the
following to your `.bazelrc`.

```
common --enable_bzlmod
```

### 2. Configure your workspace to use [rules_swift_package_manager].

#### Bzlmod: Configure your `MODULE.bazel` 

Add a dependency on `rules_swift_package_manager`.

<!-- BEGIN MODULE SNIPPET -->
```python
bazel_dep(name = "rules_swift_package_manager", version = "0.14.0")
```
<!-- END MODULE SNIPPET -->

You will also need to add a dependency on Gazelle, `rules_swift`, and possibly `rules_apple`. Follow
the links below to get the latest bzlmod snippets to insert into your `MODULE.bazel`.
- [gazelle](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/gazelle)
- [rules_swift](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/rules_swift)
- [rules_apple](https://registry.bazel.build/modules/rules_apple)

NOTE: Only some projects require the inclusion of [rules_apple]. Some Swift package manager features
(e.g., resources) use rules from [rules_apple]. While your project may not require these rules, one
of your Swift package dependencies might require this ruleset. If you just want things to work, add
[rules_apple] as a dependency. Otherwise, try building without [rules_apple] and be on the lookout
for missing depdency errors.


#### Legacy: Add declarations to your `WORKSPACE` file

Update the `WORKSPACE` file to load the dependencies for [rules_swift_package_manager], [rules_swift] and [Gazelle].

<!-- BEGIN WORKSPACE SNIPPET -->
```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

http_archive(
    name = "rules_swift_package_manager",
    sha256 = "2573b4551247e091786d284386d5dc1ad5b800ed3eaf8dc3085d6f8b070bd5ba",
    urls = [
        "https://github.com/cgrindel/rules_swift_package_manager/releases/download/v0.14.0/rules_swift_package_manager.v0.14.0.tar.gz",
    ],
)

load("@rules_swift_package_manager//:deps.bzl", "swift_bazel_dependencies")

swift_bazel_dependencies()

load("@cgrindel_bazel_starlib//:deps.bzl", "bazel_starlib_dependencies")

bazel_starlib_dependencies()

# MARK: - Gazelle

# gazelle:repo bazel_gazelle

load("@bazel_gazelle//:deps.bzl", "gazelle_dependencies")
load("@rules_swift_package_manager//:go_deps.bzl", "swift_bazel_go_dependencies")
load("@io_bazel_rules_go//go:deps.bzl", "go_register_toolchains", "go_rules_dependencies")

# Declare Go dependencies before calling go_rules_dependencies.
swift_bazel_go_dependencies()

go_rules_dependencies()

go_register_toolchains(version = "1.19.1")

gazelle_dependencies()

# MARK: - Swift Toolchain

http_archive(
    name = "build_bazel_rules_swift",
    # Populate with your preferred release 
    # https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift/releases
)

load(
    "@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:repositories.bzl",
    "swift_rules_dependencies",
)
load("//:swift_deps.bzl", "swift_dependencies")

# gazelle:repository_macro swift_deps.bzl%swift_dependencies
swift_dependencies()

swift_rules_dependencies()

load(
    "@build_bazel_rules_swift//swift:extras.bzl",
    "swift_rules_extra_dependencies",
)

swift_rules_extra_dependencies()
```
<!-- END WORKSPACE SNIPPET -->

The above `WORKSPACE` boilerplate loads a file called `swift_deps.bzl`. The Gazelle plugin will
populate it, shortly. For now, create the file with the follwing contents:

```python
# Contents of swift_deps.bzl
def swift_dependencies():
    pass
```

### 3. Create a minimal `Package.swift` file.

Create a minimal `Package.swift` file that only contains the external dependencies that are directly
used by your Bazel workspace.

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.7

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "my-project",
    dependencies: [
        // Replace these entries with your dependencies.
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser", from: "1.2.0"),
        .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-log", from: "1.4.4"),
    ]
)
```

The name of the package can be whatever you like. It is required for the manifest, but it is not
used by [rules_swift_package_manager]. If your proejct is published and consumed as a Swift package, feel free to
populate the rest of the manifest so that your package works properly by Swift package manager. Just
note that the Swift Gazelle plugin does not use the manifest to generate Bazel build files, at this
time.

### 4. Add Gazelle targets to `BUILD.bazel` at the root of your workspace.

Add the following to the `BUILD.bazel` file at the root of your workspace.

```python
load("@bazel_gazelle//:def.bzl", "gazelle", "gazelle_binary")
load("@rules_swift_package_manager//swiftpkg:defs.bzl", "swift_update_packages")

# Ignore the `.build` folder that is created by running Swift package manager 
# commands. The Swift Gazelle plugin executes some Swift package manager 
# commands to resolve external dependencies. This results in a `.build` file 
# being created.
# NOTE: Swift package manager is not used to build any of the external packages. 
# The `.build` directory should be ignored. Be sure to configure your source 
# control to ignore it (i.e., add it to your `.gitignore`).
# gazelle:exclude .build

# This declaration builds a Gazelle binary that incorporates all of the Gazelle 
# plugins for the languages that you use in your workspace. In this example, we 
# are only listing the Gazelle plugin for Swift from rules_swift_package_manager.
gazelle_binary(
    name = "gazelle_bin",
    languages = [
        "@rules_swift_package_manager//gazelle",
    ],
)

# This macro defines two targets: `swift_update_pkgs` and 
# `swift_update_pkgs_to_latest`. 
#
# The `swift_update_pkgs` target should be run whenever the list of external 
# dependencies is updated in the `Package.swift`. Running this target will 
# populate the `swift_deps.bzl` with `swift_package` declarations for all of 
# the direct and transitive Swift packages that your project uses.
# 
# The `swift_update_pkgs_to_latest` target should be run when you want to 
# update your Swift dependencies to their latest eligible version.
swift_update_packages(
    name = "swift_update_pkgs",
    gazelle = ":gazelle_bin",
    generate_swift_deps_for_workspace = False,
    update_bzlmod_stanzas = True,
)

# This target updates the Bazel build files for your project. Run this target 
# whenever you add or remove source files from your project.
gazelle(
    name = "update_build_files",
    gazelle = ":gazelle_bin",
)
```

#### Legacy: Modify the `swift_update_packages` declaration.

The configuration for the `swift_update_packages` declaration is a little differnet for the legacy
`WORKSPACE` mode.

```python
swift_update_packages(
    name = "swift_update_pkgs",
    gazelle = ":gazelle_bin",
    generate_swift_deps_for_workspace = True,
    update_bzlmod_stanzas = False,
)
```

### 5. Resolve the external dependencies for your project.

Resolve the external dependencies for your project by running the following:

```sh
$ bazel run //:swift_update_pkgs
```

### 6. Create or update Bazel build files for your project.

Generate/update the Bazel build files for your project by running the following:

```sh
$ bazel run //:update_build_files
```

### 7. Build and test your project.

Build and test your project.

```sh
$ bazel test //...
```

### 8. Check in some generated files.

#### Bzlmod: Check-in `Package.resolved`, `swift_deps_index.json`, and `MODULE.bazel`.

- The `Package.resolved` file specifies that exact versions of the dependencies that were
  identified. 
- The `swift_deps_index.json` file contains information that is used by the Gazelle plugin and the
  respository rules. 
- In addition to the declarations that you added to the `MODULE.bazel` file, executing
  `//:swift_update_pkgs` adds declarations to the end of the file related to the Swift packages that
  are used by your workspace.

#### Legacy: Check-in `Package.resolved`, `swift_deps_index.json`, and `swift_deps.bzl`.

In the legacy `WORKSPACE` mode, you will not have a `MODULE.bazel` file, but you will have a
`swift_deps.bzl` file. The `swift_deps.bzl` file contains the repository rule declarations that are
required to download and prepare the external Swift packages that are used by your workspace.


### 9. Start coding

You are ready to start coding.


## Tips and Tricks

The following are a few tips to consider as you work with your repository:

- When you add or remove source files, run `bazel run //:update_build_files`. This will
  create/update the Bazel build files in your project. It is designed to be fast and unobtrusive.
- When you add or remove an external dependency, run `bazel run //:swift_update_pkgs`. This
  will resolve the changes to your transitive dependencies and regenerate your `Package.resolved`,
  `swift_deps_index.json`, and `swift_deps.bzl` (only if you are using legacy `WORKSPACE` mode).
- If things do not appear to be working properly, run the following in this order:
  - `bazel run //:swift_update_pkgs`
  - `bazel run //:update_build_files`
- Do yourself a favor and create a Bazel target (e.g., `//:tidy`) that runs your repository
  maintenance targets (e.g., `//:swift_update_pkgs`, `//:update_build_files`, formatting utilities) 
  in the proper order.  If you are looking for an easy way to set this up, check out the 
  [`//:tidy` declaration in this repository](BUILD.bazel) and the documentation for the [tidy] macro. 
- Are you trying to use a Swift package and it just won't build under Bazel? If you can figure out
  how to fix it, you can patch the Swift package. Check out [our document on patching Swift packages].


## Future Work

- [ ] Update the Gazelle plugin to generate Bazel build files from a project's Swift package
  manifest (e.g. `Package.swift`). NOTE: The `swift_package` repository rule does generate Bazel build
  files from a package's project manifest.
- [ ] Update the Gazelle plugin to support common Swift project layouts. The Gazelle plugin knows
  how to interpret projects with `Sources` and `Tests` directories. We are looking for feedback
  about other common patterns to make the Gazelle plugin more robust.
