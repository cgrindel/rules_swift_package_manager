# google_maps Example

This example was copied from [one the demos example in
maps-sdk-for-ios-samples](https://github.com/googlemaps-samples/maps-sdk-for-ios-samples/tree/main/GoogleMaps-Swift/GoogleMapsSwiftDemos). It was simplified in order to avoid too large of an example.

## Why is this interesting?

The [lottie-spm](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-spm) downloads a dynamic xcframework. This
exercises the xcframework detection logic in `rules_swift_package_manager`.
