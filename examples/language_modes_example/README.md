# language_modes Example

This example exersizes the ways Swift 5 vs 6 language modes can be set for a package based on
https://www.swift.org/migration/documentation/swift-6-concurrency-migration-guide/swift6mode/#Package-manifest

This ensures that packages are built with their correct language modes independent of the mode the
base project is using.
