# NOTE: If you decide to move the Swift dependency files like this example, do
# not forget to update the `gazelle` declaration `//:update_build_files` to
# point at the new location of the Swift dependency index JSON file.  Also, the
# `//:gazelle_bin target` must be visible to this package.

# Ignore the Swift build folder
# gazelle:exclude .build
